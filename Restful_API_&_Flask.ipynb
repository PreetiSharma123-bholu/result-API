        "Ques-4  What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-4 Routing in Flask is the process of mapping a URL (web address) to a specific function in your Python code.Each route (URL) is linked to a view function.When a user visits that URL, Flask calls the corresponding function.\n",

        " Common HTTP Methods:\n",

        ">>PATCH → Partially update existing data\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-10 Flask doesn’t come with built-in database support, but you can connect it to SQL databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) using extensions. The most common is Flask-SQLAlchemy.\n",
        "\n",
        ">> Steps to connect Flask to a SQL database:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) Install SQLAlchemy\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) Configure Database URI in Flask app\n",

        "(4) Insert and Query Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-11 What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-11 Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that makes it easy to work with SQL databases using Python.\n",
        "It provides an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) on top of SQLAlchemy.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Roles:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) Simplifies Database Operations\n",

        "(3) CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-12 What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-12 A Blueprint in Flask is a way to organize your application into smaller, reusable modules.\n",
        "Instead of putting all routes in a single app.py, you can split them into different files using blueprints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Useful:\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Keeps large apps organized and modular.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Easier to maintain (separate routes, APIs, admin, authentication, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-13 What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-13 The request object in Flask is used to access data coming from the client (browser, mobile app, API call) when it makes an HTTP request.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-14 How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-14 To create a RESTful API endpoint in Flask, you define a route using the @app.route() decorator and specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that the endpoint should respond to. Inside the route function, you use Flask’s request object to read incoming data (such as query parameters, form data, or JSON) and then return a response, usually in JSON format using jsonify().\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-15 What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-15 The jsonify() function in Flask is used to create a proper JSON response from Python dictionaries or lists. Instead of manually converting Python objects into JSON strings, jsonify() does it automatically and also sets the correct Content-Type header (application/json) in the HTTP response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-16 Explain Flask’s url_for() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-16 The url_for() function in Flask is used to generate dynamic URLs for your routes based on the function name rather than hardcoding the URL paths. This is very useful because if you ever change a route’s path, you don’t need to manually update every place where it’s used — url_for() will automatically generate the correct URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-17 How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-17 Flask handles static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images through a special folder named static in your project directory. By default, Flask automatically serves any files placed inside this folder at the URL path /static/.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-18 What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-18 n API specification is a detailed description (or contract) that defines how an API should work. It outlines the available endpoints (URLs), the HTTP methods they support (GET, POST, etc.), the input parameters (query strings, request body, headers), the response format (usually JSON), and the possible error codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of building a Flask API, an API specification helps in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        ">>It provides a clear guide for developers about what endpoints exist and how to use them.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>It ensures consistency between frontend and backend teams by acting as a shared contract.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>It helps with documentation and can be used to automatically generate interactive API docs (like Swagger UI).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-19 What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-19 HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers sent by the server in response to a client’s request, indicating the result of that request.In a Flask API, status codes are important because they make your API more clear, professional, and standardized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-20 How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-20 In Flask, handling a POST request means creating a route that accepts data sent from the client (like form data, JSON, or files) and processes it. You define this route using the @app.route() decorator with methods=[\"POST\"]. Inside the route function, you use Flask’s request object to access the data. For form submissions, you can use request.form; for JSON payloads (common in REST APIs), you use request.json. After processing, you usually return a response, often in JSON format using jsonify(), along with an appropriate HTTP status code such as 201 Created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-21 How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-21 Securing a Flask API is crucial to protect data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure safe communication between clients and the server. There are several best practices for securing a Flask API:\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Use Authentication & Authorization\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement API keys, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or OAuth2 to ensure only authorized users can access endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS)\n",
        "\n",
        "Always deploy your API over HTTPS so data is encrypted during transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-22 What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-22 Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that makes it easier to build RESTful APIs. While Flask by itself is great, you often need to write extra boilerplate code to handle things like request parsing, response formatting, and organizing multiple API endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques-23 What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-23 The session object in Flask is used to store data for a user across multiple requests. Since HTTP is stateless (it doesn’t remember anything between requests), the session provides a way to keep track of user information temporarily, like login status, preferences, or shopping cart data."
